                Hello there! <br /> My name is Jakub.
            </h2>

        <p>
            I'm a frontend developer who's all about creating awesome web
            experiences. TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Astro nad Tailwind are
            my tools of choice for creating high performance good looking UIs
            with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm all about little details. Always making sure pixels are just
            right and user experience is as good and simple as it can be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, you'll find me geeking about all latest science
            and tech trends, riding my bike, watching formula 1 races or playing
            with my two cute cats - Pyza and Cha≈Çka.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this website I learn all things web related, try out new
            technologies and spend time changing colors whenever I feel like it.
            Keeping triple 100/100 lighthouse score is my mission!
        </p>
