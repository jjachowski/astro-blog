		<p>
			I'm a frontend developer who always looks forward to yet another js framework. Currently
			TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Astro nad Tailwind are my tools of choice for creating high
			performance good looking UIs with ease.
		</p>
		<p>Can't stand plain JS, always ready to refactor to TypeScript.</p>
		<p>Trying not to fall into a trap of good practices™, doing what feels and looks right.</p>
		<p>I enjoy doing code reviews, there's almost always something cool to learn for both sides.</p>
		<p>
			Outside of coding, you'll find me geeking about all latest science and tech trends, riding my
			bike, watching formula 1 races or playing with my two cute cats - Pyza and Chałka.
		</p>
		<p>
			On this website I learn all things web related, try out new technologies and spend time
			changing colors whenever I feel like it. Keeping triple 100/100 lighthouse score is my
			mission!
