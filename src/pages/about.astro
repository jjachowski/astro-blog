                Hello there! <br /> My name is Jakub.
            </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            I'm a frontend developer who always looks forward to yet another js
            framework. Currently TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Astro nad
            Tailwind are my tools of choice for creating high performance good
            looking UIs with ease.
        </p>
        <p>Can't stand plain JS, always ready to refactor to TypeScript.</p>
        <p>
            Trying not to fall into a trap of good practices™, doing what feels
            and looks right.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy doing code reviews, there's almost always something cool to
            learn for both sides.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, you'll find me geeking about all latest science
            and tech trends, riding my bike, watching formula 1 races or playing
            with my two cute cats - Pyza and Chałka.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this website I learn all things web related, try out new
            technologies and spend time changing colors whenever I feel like it.
            Keeping triple 100/100 lighthouse score is my mission!
        </p>
