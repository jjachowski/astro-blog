# MDX

So why do I need MDX and what even is that? In short - it's a markdown file in which you can use JavaScript and all it's benefits. Want to calculate something? Get todays date? _{(new Date()).toLocaleDateString("pl-PL")}_. Use some of your existing _React_ component? Say no more, MDX got you covered! ‚¨áÔ∏è

<Greeting client:load messages={["Hi MDX", "MDX is cool", "Hello!"]} />

## Installation and configuration

As most things in _Astro_, enabling MDX was a piece of cake. It all came down to runing single command to install required astro package and then adding file association for _vscode_ to tread `.mdx` files the same way as `.md`.

```zsh
# in terminal using yarn
npm install @astrojs/mdx
```

```json
// astro.config.mjs
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.mdx": "markdown"
  }
}
// TODO: create some component to display file name when using code block ü•≤
```

And just like that, I could use all the features of MDX in my astro app.

Unfortunatley developer experience was far from optimal, I had many issues configuring eslint in `mdx` files. The biggest problem for me was that _intelisense_ was not working at all in MDX files so importing and using components was a pain. After trying with many settings that were resolving some problems while creating new ones I decided to leave it as is for now - without eslint working at all for MDX files. If you know how to setup eslint for such use case - _please let me know! - jakub@jachowski.dev_.
