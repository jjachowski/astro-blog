# UPDATE!

## Work - a lot of stuff

Work was incredibily busy lately, with a ot of SEO related tickes and new requirements with short deadlines. You know how it is, when you get tired at work you don't want to sit another hour at the same desk in your free time (that why I bought steamdeck - so I can play in bed lol).

## Personal Projects

Recently together with a cool dude named Staszek we started working on a _side project_ - cms written with next.js and other libraries we wanted to explore.

## Hobbies and free time

To chill out after work I was mostly gaming. I've been totally hooked on Monster Hunter World: Iceborne lately. It's been awesome exploring new areas and taking down big monsters. And of course, I've been playing a bunch of other games too, Gran Turismo 7, Deep Rock Galactica Survivor, Stardew Valles and some more. It's just a great way to unwind and have some fun. Can't wait Dragon's Dogma release later this month!

## Wrapping up

I'll try to add something new more regularly! Peace!
